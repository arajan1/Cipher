Law and Punishment in League of Legends
Background Information
League of Legends is a popular online game which is played in many independent matches. In each match, two teams of ?ve players compete on a symmetric map to destroy the opposing team¡¯s objectives while defending their own. Teams are often made up of strangers who will never play together again. Effective communication and teamwork are important factors in winning a match, and a lack of cooperation often leads to losing a match. This need for cooperation and communication with teammates makes a player¡¯s experience highly dependent on social interactions with other players. In a game, players must use re?exes, knowledge of the game, and cooperation to defeat the enemy team. Multiple game modes are available, including a ranked mode where players compete to enter higher divisions and earn recognition.

In a hyper-competitive environment like that of ranked League of Legends gameplay, it is natural for players to have high expectations for their teammates, and when mistakes are made by teammates some players might make abrasive comments and personal attacks toward the person who made the mistake. This kind of behavior, also known as toxicity, has been shown, expectedly, to work against its purpose and worsen the performance of the recipient of the criticism. Naturally, it is in the interest of the community to maintain a positive environment and of the game company to reduce the amount of players who stop playing the game because of the toxicity. Many methods of doing so have been suggested and attempted, though each have their own flaws and mirrors for law in the real world in some way.
Because it is much more difficult to reform a random offender online and reduce his negative behavior, it might be quite tempting for the policy-maker to resort to non-rehabilitative punishment in the form of a ¡°prisoner¡¯s island.¡± Akin to prisons in the world of A Clockwork Orange, putting negative players in games with each other fulfills only the incapacitation aspect of punishment as they are no longer able to harm the rest of the community, presumed to be neutral or positive. Like real world prisons, creating a concentration of criminal behavior only creates a negative feedback loop and causes more of the same kind of behavior to develop within it and works against the other purposes of punishment, especially rehabilitation. According to Lead Game Designer of Social Systems of Jeffrey Lin, as players are exposed to more negative behavior, they just become more likely to quit playing any particular game--up to 320% more likely, in fact. Such a form of punishment also lacks the justification provided by a social contract - the community has no say in the judgment, and the game developer is judge, jury, and executioner.
Another method previously introduced by the game developer was the Tribunal system, likely inspired by jury trials in real life. Players in good standing would volunteer to review cases of offending players and vote on whether they deserve to be punished and what punishment (permanent ban, time ban, warning, pardon) to deal out. This system is more justified socially in that it utilizes a jury of peers, rather than the omnipotent game developer, in judging the actions of the subject. As we see in Alex¡¯s gangs in the start and end of A Clockwork Orange, a large part of one¡¯s motivation to commit crimes or rules violations stems from peer influence, and suppression or reversal of said influence could prove key to the reduction of crimes. According to Shores et.al, playing with friends significantly increased toxicity - a player may experience a con?ict between community norms and the norms of their group of friends - behavior that deviates from community norms may be encouraged by friends. Much of this is frequently ignored in Western, especially American, legal systems. One can also observe this from the everlasting debate between Confucianism and Legalism in ancient China. Confucius taught people community building and moral education, while Legalists advocated for stricter implementation of laws. Ultimately, a two-pronged approach is needed to best tackle deviant and rule-violating behavior.
However, it is often in the nature of players who are toxically inclined to engage in negative behavior, just like how the Ludovico technique ultimately failed to ¡°reform¡± Alex in the novel. As sentient beings with free will, our decisions to follow law or relevant rules are relative and not always rational - all that punishment accomplishes is merely to put more weight on the rule-abiding side of our internal scale. Thus rehabilitation becomes a sort of a null point - attempted rehabilitation in many cases is purely a disguise for deterrence where the subject of punishment displays ¡°good intentions.¡± As we have seen with Alex, changing one¡¯s way of thinking is difficult if not impossible, and if it were to be accomplished, is arguably an interference with one¡¯s free will.  A recent example lies in a well-known League of Legends player, nicknamed ¡°Tyler1,¡± who was extremely toxic and publicly broadcast his gameplay and offensive behavior on a live streaming website. As expected, his accounts were often banned as a result, though then he would simply open another account and continue with the same behavior. In particular, after he gained massive fame from a video intended to expose his toxicity, he announced that he would ¡°reform¡± and cease to be abrasive toward others; he was able to maintain his ¡°reformation¡± for about two weeks, but was unable to continue with that degree of self-control and reverted to his original pattern. In the end, due to community outrage, the game developer was forced to issue a statement that they would ban any account upon confirmation that it is controlled by ¡°Tyler1,¡± hardly in line with the developers¡¯ stated purpose of reform.
Though League of Legends is just a video game, punishment in the game in some cases can bear more emotional significance than certain real-life punishments. Its nature of stranger versus stranger gameplay is reflective of many real life cases, and its largely youth population parallels that of the world around Alex in A Clockwork Orange. It shows that in devising rules and laws, policymakers must avoid falling into the trap of ¡°Prisoner¡¯s Island,¡± take into account the limitations of the purpose of law, as well as effectively utilize the power of the community. There is a lesson to be learned by the United States from Scandinavian countries, where the environment and atmosphere of prisons are much more pleasant as well as focused on reformation and rehabilitation of prisoners.

I have always loved challenges, and when someone hears the name Carnegie Mellon, a former trade school, one thinks of hard work rather than late-night parties or slacking off. In grade school, math and science teachers and textbooks spoon-feed results and theorems without proofs. This all changed when I met Mr. Ibbotson, who would always clarify a complicated concept in the multivariable calculus textbook with an intuitive, diagram-based proof with easy-to-understand steps. The rigor and beauty of an elegant proof is what makes learning complete, in a sense, to me. A large number of computer science electives at CMU, such as 80-311: Undecidability and Incompleteness and 21-484: Graph Theory, all emphasize mathematically sound proofs.
SCS is also home to the world¡¯s only academic Machine Learning Department, which focuses on the field in computer science I am most passionate about. It is a field in which I can make the most difference in the world, whether through better algorithms for genome sequencing or intelligent analysis of MRI images to identify diseases. Countless hours spent Googling the solution to a mysterious error message in my program, carefully implementing the Q-Learning algorithm described in a research paper¡­ I am a person who learns by doing. The project-based courses at CMU let students implement and explore the theoretical ideas they learn in class in a creative way. The opportunity for students to do research with a faculty mentor as an Independent Study that culminates in a Senior Thesis will allow me, as an undergraduate, to make real contributions to the field myself rather than be a small part of a large research project. The kind of research SCS undergraduates are doing is quite fascinating and advanced, like one recent Senior Thesis that involved designing a new heuristics-based algorithm for purposes of machine learning.
I would like to become a part of the organizing team for CMU¡¯s hackathons, HackCMU and TartanHacks. A hackathon is a great opportunity for makers of different backgrounds to create something in 24 hours and showcase it to peers and potential investors. Organizing HackExeter, a hackathon at my high school, was an exciting experience for me, where seventy middle and high school students were able to dip their feet in computer science by creating a project of their own. The reputation and connections of CMU would be a great improvement and enables a CMU hackathon to be larger and more successful.
In addition to organizing hackathons, I would love to continue my interest in competitive programming. Ever since Ray introduced me to the world of competitive programming, I have always marveled at the beauty of the problems. Preprocessing the points, then using dynamic programming sped up by convex hull algorithms, and finally using binary search on the above process to find the solution. The thrill of solving a complex problem while participating in an online competition keeps me up at night and is why I believe computer science is artistic. CMU fields strong teams for the competition and routinely places among the top teams in the ACM-ICPC World Finals, even winning a gold medal in 2011. Whether in chess, programming, or math, I love the spirit of competition and hope to contribute to CMU¡¯s success at the ACM-ICPC.
I chose SCS and CMU because I would be able to take advantage of the myriad opportunities at CMU and that it would be the best place for my future success. At CMU, I would be able to explore my dreams and aspirations in ways I never thought possible.
